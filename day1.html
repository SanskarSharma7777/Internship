        <p class="px-4 py-2">Nature is all the animals, plants, and other things in the world that are not made by people,
            and all the events and processes that are not caused by people. The most amazing thing about nature is its infinite variety.
            ... grasses that grow wild in nature.</p>

        <p class="px-4 py-2">Sunsets are bold, brilliant, and rich in color. They are bright, beautiful, and
            mesmerizing. So unless you want to focus more on other parts of the scenery, it usually won't suffice to say something
            like "the sky was bright orange and red".</p>
